## Introduction
The developer must design a free hosted UI for the Python code in this repository.
This is a sentiment classification code that displays results as "POSITIVE" or "NEGATIVE" based on the sentiment of the input text.
The algorithm also gives word redundancy and highlights repeated words.


## Steps

### What are the steps in this project?
1. Please clone this repository and download all of the requirements from requirements.txt into your virtual environment.
2. Download the model from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1exoJhG2Maj5sqjZ1802tjdTS46FRJtsr?usp=sharing).
3. Create a UI based on the model and code.
4. Host this project as a webapp on a free hosted service.

### What is the expected from?

The UI should look like this:

**For assement submission please fill this** [google form](https://forms.gle/WFGBUw1erBJN3Szj8)

**IMPORTANT**: Please keep in mind that all open-source and free services should be used to host this application.

1. The URL of the webapp that you hosted.
2. A detailed description of your implementation.(What deployment services did you employ? Where did you obtain the domain? and related information)
4. OPTIONAL: You can play with the code and create your own features (based on NLP, transformers, or rule-based logic) to improve app usability.
